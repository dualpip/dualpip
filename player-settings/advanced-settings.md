## Open Iframe in New Tab

When a video is in an iframe, Picture-in-Picture functionality enables network transmission to send the iframe video to the main page for playback, which is equivalent to playing two videos simultaneously. If you experience lag or high resource usage, you can enable this option to open the iframe URL in a new tab first, then enable Picture-in-Picture functionality.

**Note**: New tabs opened this way may not play videos properly.
